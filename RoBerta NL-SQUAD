Na zijn uitvinding en vroege ontwikkeling in Italië verspreidde de mandoline zich over het Europese continent. Het instrument werd voornamelijk gebruikt in een klassieke traditie met mandoline-orkesten, de zogenaamde Estudiantinas of in Duitsland Zupforchestern die in veel steden optraden. Na deze continentale populariteit van de mandolinefamilie verschenen er lokale tradities buiten Europa in Amerika en in Japan. Reizende mandolinevirtuozen zoals Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace en Silvio Ranieri droegen ertoe bij dat de mandoline in het begin van de 20e eeuw een 'rage'-instrument werd. Deze \"mandoline-rage\" vervaagde in de jaren dertig, maar net toen deze praktijk in onbruik raakte, vond de mandoline een nieuwe niche in de Amerikaanse country, oude muziek, bluegrass en volksmuziek. Meer recentelijk hebben het barokke en klassieke mandolinerepertoire en -stijlen geprofiteerd van het toegenomen bewustzijn van en interesse in oude muziek, met media-aandacht voor klassieke spelers zoals de Israëliër Avi Avital, de Italiaan Carlo Aonzo en de Amerikaan Joseph Brent.</td>\n","      <td>{'answer_start': [397], 'text': ['klassieke traditie met mandoline-orkesten']}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Waar woont 90% van de bevolking in Himachal Pradesh?</td>\n","      <td>57096e1c200fba1400367fd3</td>\n","      <td>Himachal_Pradesh</td>\n","      <td>Himachal Pradesh is verspreid over valleien en 90% van de bevolking woont in dorpen en steden.
