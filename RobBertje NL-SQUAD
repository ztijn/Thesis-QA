Deze omvatten verhandelingen over de profeten (die hij beschouwde als \"geïnspireerde filosofen\"), en ook over verschillende wetenschappelijke en filosofische interpretaties van de koran, zoals hoe de kosmologie van de koran overeenkomt met zijn eigen filosofische systeem.

In plaats van traditionele QA-focussen te vervangen, vergroot het deze. Development Testing heeft tot doel constructiefouten te elimineren voordat code wordt gepromoveerd tot QA; deze strategie is bedoeld om de kwaliteit van de resulterende software te verhogen, evenals de efficiëntie van het algehele ontwikkelings- en QA-proces.</td>\n","      <td>Software_testing</td>\n","      <td>Wanneer wordt ontwikkelingstest niet gebruikt?</td>\n","      <td>{'answer_start': [], 'text': []}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <td>57316cb605b4da19006bd134</td>\n","      <td>Gaddafi's vroegste opleiding was van religieuze aard, gegeven door een plaatselijke islamitische leraar. Vervolgens verhuisde hij naar het nabijgelegen Sirte om naar de lagere school te gaan, waar hij in vier jaar tijd zes klassen doorliep. Onderwijs in Libië was niet gratis, maar zijn vader dacht dat zijn zoon er ondanks de financiële druk veel baat bij zou hebben. Gaddafi sliep doordeweeks in een moskee en in het weekend liep hij 32 kilometer om zijn ouders te bezoeken. Gepest omdat hij een bedoeïen was, was hij trots op zijn identiteit en moedigde hij trots aan bij andere bedoeïenenkinderen. Van Sirte verhuisden hij en zijn gezin naar de marktstad Sabha in Fezzan, zuid-centraal Libië, waar zijn vader werkte als conciërge voor een stamleider terwijl Muammar naar de middelbare school ging, iets wat geen van beide ouders had gedaan.
