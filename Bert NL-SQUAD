Hij leidde de namen van nieuwe items af door uitsluitingsleren en haalde die nieuwe items onmiddellijk en ook 4 weken na de eerste blootstelling correct terug. Honden hebben geavanceerde geheugenvaardigheden. Een studie documenteerde de leer- en geheugencapaciteiten van een border collie, \"Chaser\", die de namen had geleerd en meer dan 1000 woorden kon associëren met verbale commando's. Honden zijn in staat menselijke lichaamstaal, zoals gebaren en wijzen, te lezen en erop te reageren, en menselijke stemcommando's te begrijpen. Honden demonstreren een theorie van de geest door bedrog te plegen. Een studie toonde overtuigend bewijs dat Australische dingo's beter kunnen presteren dan gedomesticeerde honden in niet-sociale probleemoplossende experimenten, wat aangeeft dat gedomesticeerde honden mogelijk veel van hun oorspronkelijke probleemoplossende vermogen hebben verloren toen ze zich bij mensen voegden. Een andere studie toonde aan dat honden die een onoplosbare versie van hetzelfde probleem tegenkomen na een training om een eenvoudige manipulatietaak op te lossen, naar de mens kijken, terwijl gesocialiseerde wolven dat niet doen.

Ondertussen zijn de \"dialecten\" die ondergeschikt zijn aan de standaardtaal over het algemeen geen variaties op de standaardtaal, maar eerder afzonderlijke (maar vaak verwante) talen op zich. Zo zijn de meeste van de verschillende regionale Romaanse talen van Italië, in de volksmond vaak Italiaanse 'dialecten' genoemd, in feite niet echt afgeleid van het moderne standaard Italiaans, maar eerder geëvolueerd uit het Vulgair Latijn, afzonderlijk en individueel van elkaar en onafhankelijk van elkaar. van standaard Italiaans, lang voordat een nationale gestandaardiseerde taal werd verspreid in wat nu Italië is. Deze verschillende van het Latijn afgeleide regionale talen zijn daarom in taalkundige zin niet echt \"dialecten\" van de standaard Italiaanse taal, maar kunnen in plaats daarvan beter worden gedefinieerd als hun eigen afzonderlijke talen. Omgekeerd, met de verspreiding van standaard Italiaans in heel Italië in de 20e eeuw, ontwikkelden zich verschillende regionale versies of varianten van standaard Italiaans, meestal als een mix van het nationale standaard Italiaans met lokale regionale talen en lokale accenten. Deze variaties op standaard Italiaans, bekend als regionaal Italiaans, zouden beter \"dialecten\" kunnen worden genoemd in overeenstemming met de eerste taalkundige definitie van \"dialect\", aangezien ze in feite gedeeltelijk of grotendeels zijn afgeleid van standaard Italiaans.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>572688895951b619008f7603</td>\n","      <td>Wat deed Jack Brickhouse toen hij zijn pensioengerechtigde leeftijd naderde?</td>\n","      <td>{'answer_start': [627], 'text': ['beval hij persoonlijk zijn opvolger']}</td>\n","      <td>Chicago_Cubs</td>\n","      <td>Jack Brickhouse bemande de Cubs-radio en vooral de tv-cabine gedurende delen van vijf decennia, de periode van 34 seizoenen van 1948 tot 1981.

Veel lokale carnavalsgebruiken zouden voortkomen uit lokale voorchristelijke rituelen, zoals uitgebreide rituelen met gemaskerde figuren in de Zwabisch-Alemannische Fastnacht. Er is echter onvoldoende bewijs om een directe oorsprong van Saturnalia of andere oude festivals vast te stellen. Er zijn geen volledige verslagen van Saturnalia bewaard gebleven en de gedeelde kenmerken van feesten, rolwisselingen, tijdelijke sociale gelijkheid, maskers en toegestane regelovertreding vormen niet noodzakelijkerwijs een samenhangend festival of verbinden deze festivals. Deze overeenkomsten kunnen een reservoir van culturele hulpbronnen vertegenwoordigen die meerdere betekenissen en functies kunnen belichamen. Pasen begint bijvoorbeeld met de opstanding van Jezus, gevolgd door een liminale periode en eindigt met wedergeboorte. Carnaval keert dit om als koning Carnaval tot leven komt, er volgt een liminale periode voor zijn dood. Beide feesten worden berekend door de maankalender. Zowel Jezus als Koning Carnaval kunnen worden gezien als verzoenende figuren die met hun dood een geschenk aan de mensen schenken. In het geval van Jezus is het geschenk eeuwig leven in de hemel en in het geval van Koning Carnaval de erkenning dat de dood een noodzakelijk onderdeel is van de levenscyclus. Naast christelijk antijudaïsme suggereren de overeenkomsten tussen kerkelijke en carnavalsrituelen en beeldspraak een gemeenschappelijke wortel. De passie van Christus is zelf grotesk: sinds het vroege christendom wordt Christus voorgesteld als het slachtoffer van een kort geding, wordt hij gemarteld en geëxecuteerd door de Romeinen voor een joodse menigte (\"Zijn bloed is op ons en op onze kinderen!\" Mattheüs 27:24-25). Tijdens processies in de Goede Week in Spanje zijn er menigten die de figuur van Jezus luidruchtig beledigen. Oneerbiedigheid, parodie, degradatie en gelach om een tragikomische beeltenis van God kunnen worden gezien als intensiveringen van de heilige orde. In 1466 herleefde de katholieke kerk onder paus Paulus II de gewoonten van het Saturnalia-carnaval: Joden werden gedwongen naakt door de straten van de stad Rome te racen. “Voordat ze gingen rennen, werden de Joden rijkelijk gevoed, om de race voor hen moeilijker te maken en tegelijkertijd leuker voor de toeschouwers. Ze renden... temidden van Rome's treiterende kreten en gelach, terwijl de Heilige Vader op een rijkelijk versierd balkon stond en hartelijk lachte', meldt een ooggetuige.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>5728fa232ca10214002dab63</td>\n","      <td>Wat werden er in de Tokugawa-periode aan de huwelijkscriteria toegevoegd?</td>\n","      <td>{'answer_start': [219], 'text': ['intelligentie en opleiding af te wegen als wenselijke eigenschappen']}</td>\n","      <td>Samurai</td>\n","      <td>Naarmate de Tokugawa-periode vorderde, werd er meer waarde gehecht aan onderwijs, en het onderwijs van vrouwen vanaf jonge leeftijd werd belangrijk voor gezinnen en de samenleving als geheel.

Deze zelfde belofte werd in 1764 aan de Huron Nation ontleend en in 1765 aan de Delaware Nation, hoewel er geen melding is dat er ooit slaven zijn teruggestuurd. Talrijke advertenties vroegen om de terugkeer van Afro-Amerikanen die met inheemse Amerikanen waren getrouwd of die een inheemse Amerikaanse taal spraken. De primaire blootstelling die Afrikanen en inheemse Amerikanen aan elkaar hadden, kwam door de instelling van slavernij. Inheemse Amerikanen leerden dat Afrikanen wat inheemse Amerikanen beschouwden als 'groot medicijn' in hun lichaam hadden, omdat Afrikanen vrijwel immuun waren voor de ziekten uit de Oude Wereld die de meeste inheemse bevolkingsgroepen decimeerden.
